# tv-vs-og 

A base template for a CLJS app that includes the following:
- reagent
- re-frame
- Material UI
- Sass

## Get started

To get started, clone this repo and rename it by running: `git clone https://github.com/JordanSkousen/tv-vs-og <your project name>`

Then, in your favorite editor, perform a Find and Replace In All Files for:
- `tv-vs-og`
- `tv_vs_og`

Replacing each with your project's name. Also be sure to rename the folder `src\tv_vs_og`.

Start the dev server with `yarn start` *(don't forget to run `yarn install` first!)*, and build it with `yarn build`.

After that, you're on your own. Bye!
