# cljs-re-re-template 

A base template for a CLJS app that includes the following:
- [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent)
- [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame)
- [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Get started

1. To get started, clone this repo and rename it by running: `git clone --dissociate https://github.com/JordanSkousen/cljs-re-re-template <your project name>`

2. Then, in your favorite editor, perform a Find and Replace In All Files for (replacing each with your project's name):
   - `cljs-re-re-template`
   - `cljs_re_re_template`

3. Also be sure to rename the folder `src\cljs_re_re_template`.

4. Start the dev server with `yarn start` *(don't forget to run `yarn install` first!)*, and build it with `yarn build`.

After that, you're on your own. Bye!
