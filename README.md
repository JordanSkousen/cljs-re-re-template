## Get started

To get started, clone this repo and rename it by running: `git clone https://github.com/JordanSkousen/cljs-re-re-template <your project name>`

Then, in your favorite editor, perform a Find and Replace for:
- `cljs-re-re-template`
- `cljs_re_re_template`
Replacing each with your project's name.

Start the dev server with `yarn start`, and build it with `yarn build`.

After that, you're on your own. Bye!
